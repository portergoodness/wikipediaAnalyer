As a child, he and his older sister, Gloria, would reenact the \"clean parts\" of ''Saturday Night Live'' that his parents had taped for him.<ref name=\"NYMagazine\" /> Fallon was such a fan that he made a weekly event of watching the show in his dormitory during college. In his teens, he impressed his parents with different impersonations, the first being of [[James Cagney]]<ref name=\"Star Bio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tribute.ca/people/Jimmy+Fallon/10077|title=Jimmy Fallon star bio|publisher=Tribute Entertainment Media Group|accessdate=May 10, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p532752/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=AMG Artist: Jimmy Fallon|last=Wilson|first=MacKenzie|publisher=Macrovision Corporation|accessdate=May 10, 2009}}</ref> (he would later move into Cagney's building).

===Education===


Fallon attended [[St. Mary of the Snow (school)|St. Mary of the Snow]], a [[Roman Catholic]] elementary school in Saugerties, and later graduated from Saugerties High School in 1992.  He then attended [[The College of Saint Rose]] in [[Albany, New York]].

==Career==





===Stand-up===


Fallon gives credit to [[troll doll]]s for his big break. He was given a \"troll doll\" with a graduation cap in his senior year of high school. His mother heard about an impression contest at [[Bananas Comedy Club]] in Poughkeepsie, NY. Fallon came up with a stand-up routine that was a commercial for troll dolls. He would impersonate various celebrities auditioning to be the spokesperson. He won the contest and after college he began to do stand-up tours. When he was in Los Angeles, he took improv classes with [[The Groundlings]].<ref name=\"Star Bio\"/>





===Early work===


Fallon appeared in the feature film ''The Scheme'' (originally entitled ''The Entrepreneurs''). His one line in ''Father's Day'' was cut but he can still be seen in the background. In 1998, Fallon appeared briefly on the show ''[[Spin City]]'' in the second season as a man selling photographs. By late 1998, Fallon was studying at the Groundlings Theater in Los Angeles, making $7.50 a set at [[The Improv]] Theater, when he was summoned to New York to audition for the long-running late night [[sketch comedy]] show, ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Fallon did his impersonations of [[Jerry Seinfeld]],<ref>Brady, Shirley, et al.  \"JIMMY FALLON\". ''People'' (July 10, 2000).

===''Saturday Night Live''===


Fallon's impersonations helped land him on ''Saturday Night Live'' as a featured player in the 1998\u20131999 season,<ref>No byline (August 29, 2002), \"Jimmy Fallon is here on MTV, there on 'SNL' and ...\". ''USA Today''.</ref> and he was promoted to full cast member in the summer of 1999.<ref name=\"NYMagazine\"/>  Among his signature bits were his song parodies, which he performed when [[Colin Quinn]] was doing ''Update'' and continued to showcase on special occasions after he had replaced him.  He became co-anchor of ''[[Weekend Update]]'' with [[Tina Fey]] with the October 7, 2000 season premiere.<ref>Wolk, Josh (October 13, 2000), \"2 'LIVE' CREW\". ''Entertainment Weekly''. (563):11</ref> Fallon left ''SNL'' in 2004 and began pursuing a film career.

The show, titled ''Late Night with Jimmy Fallon'', first aired on March 2, 2009, with guests [[Robert De Niro]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Nick Carter (musician)|Nick Carter]], and musical guest [[Van Morrison]]. Guests on the show's first week included [[Tina Fey]], [[Jon Bon Jovi]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Donald Trump]], and [[Drew Barrymore]].





''Late Night'' sometimes features parodies by Fallon impersonating various musicians, and he has been praised for his ability to pull off spot-on impressions. Fallon often changes the lyrics to honor a recent event in popular culture and videos of these performances tend to go viral.  In one segment, on May 26, 2011, Fallon impersonated [[Neil Young]], singing along with guests [[Graham Nash]] and [[David Crosby]], of [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]]. Recent parodies include Fallon impersonating [[Eddie Vedder]] and [[Pearl Jam]] performing \"Jeremy (Lin)\" in light of the hysteria surrounding New York Knicks shocking standout [[Jeremy Lin]], [[the Doors]] singing the theme song to the PBS children's show ''[[Reading Rainbow]]'', Neil Young's version of the ''[[Fresh Prince of Bel Air]]'' theme song, and [[David Bowie]]'s \"[[Space Oddity]]\" with inspiration by [[Denver Broncos]] [[quarterback]] [[Tim Tebow]]. First appearing in January 2012, and dubbing himself as \"Tebowie\", Fallon's impersonation of the famously-religious quarterback went viral. Due to overwhelmingly positive acclaim from the public, Fallon revived the act on March 20, 2012, after the Denver Broncos acquired superstar quarterback [[Peyton Manning]], and revealed their intentions to trade Tebow.  Fallon continues to do impersonations, particularly of famous singers, in some of the show's comedy segments.





To celebrate the second anniversary on March 2, 2011, [[Ben & Jerry's]] launched a personalized \"Late Night Snack\" ice cream. This was immediately parodied on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' the next day and the latter's host [[Stephen Colbert]] engaged in a brief ice cream personality war with Fallon. Colbert used numerous \"fecal matter\" jokes to describe the flavor of the ice cream named after Fallon.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/03/04/jimmy-fallon-and-stephen-colbert-its-an-ice-cream-war|title=Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert: It's an Ice-Cream War | work=Time | date=March 4, 2011}}</ref>





On November 21, 2011, [[U.S. Representative]] [[Michele Bachmann]], who was active in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012|Republican presidential primaries]] at the time, appeared as a guest on ''Late Night''. As she walked onto the set, The Roots played a song by [[Fishbone]], titled \"Lyin' Ass Bitch\", humming the lyrics. Hours earlier, drummer Ahmir [[Questlove]] Thompson had sent a tweet about the song choice: \"late night walkon song devotees: you love it when we snark: this next one takes the cake. ask around cause i aint tweeting title.\" [sic] After a prominent Democratic [[Congresswoman]] complained, Fallon made a general apology by tweet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/11/jimmy-fallons-drummer-grounded-for-bachmanns-bitch-song/ |title=Jimmy Fallon Drummer Calls Bachmann \u2018Bitch\u2019 Song \u2018Tongue in Cheek\u2019 |publisher=ABC News |date=November 22, 2011 |accessdate=September 19, 2012}}</ref> Fallon began his tweet with the words: \"I'm honored that @michelebachmann was on our show yesterday and I'm so sorry about the intro mess.\"<ref name=\"entertainment.msnbc.msn.com\">{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/11/22/8955112-fallon-apologizes-to-michele-bachmann |title=Fallon apologizes to Michele Bachmann |publisher=NBC News Entertainment |date=November 12, 2011 |accessdate=September 19, 2012}}</ref> Fallon also used his Twitter account to tease Questlove that he was \"grounded\".<ref name=\"entertainment.msnbc.msn.com\"/>

In January 2014, Fallon (impersonating singer [[Bruce Springsteen]]) performed, along with Springsteen himself, a parody of Springsteen's hit song \"[[Born to Run]]\" which mocked [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] and his alleged role in the [[Fort Lee lane closure scandal]].<ref name=borntorun>{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Fionnuala|title=Born to Run 2014: Bruce Springsteen parodies himself with Jimmy Fallon in reworked version of classic hit|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/born-to-run-2014-bruce-springsteen-parodies-himself-with-jimmy-fallon-in-reworked-version-of-classic-hit-29918945.html|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=January 16, 2014|date=January 15, 2014}}</ref>

Fallon also hosted the [[2005 MTV Movie Awards]] and played [[Anakin Skywalker]] in a comedic parody of ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'''s [[Mustafar]] scene, in which Anakin and Padme have their last conversation.

In 2006, Fallon starred in \"Spontaneous Combustion\", a [[Traktor]]-directed [[Pepsi]] television commercial with actress [[Parker Posey]].

The doorman finally recognizes him for his role in ''[[Taxi (2004 film)|Taxi]]'', but still will not let him in. He later masqueraded as [[Russell Brand]] before being led off by Williamson, and made one final appearance in a cameo role as the front of a [[pantomime horse]] in the [[Al Murray]] \"pub landlord\" routine. He also provided the voice of Dylan in ''[[Doogal]]''.





In 2007, Fallon wrote the song \"Car Wash for Peace\" and donated all proceeds to charity. He performed the song on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' and ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' and dedicated a MySpace page to the cause. Around the same time, a video circulated on various Internet sites called lonelyfallon32, in which Fallon parodied YouTube celebrity Jessica Rose (a.k.a. [[lonelygirl15]]) and later performed the song.





Fallon, along with his sister Gloria, wrote ''I Hate This Place: The Pessimist's Guide to Life'' for TV Books in 1999.

On June 12, 2012, Fallon released his second comedy album, ''[[Blow Your Pants Off]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Josh|title=Jimmy Fallon Blow Your Pants Off album review|url=http://www.thespittake.com/2012/06/12/jimmy-fallon-blow-your-pants-off-warner-brothers/|publisher=The Spit Take|accessdate=April 9, 2013}}</ref>  Most of the songs come from his ''Late Night'' impersonations, such as Tebowie and Neil Young. The album is also notable for its guest appearances, which include [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Dave Matthews]], [[Big & Rich]], and newscaster [[Brian Williams]]. The album won a Grammy in 2013 for [[Best Comedy Album]]. In an interview with [[American Songwriter]], Fallon stated that \"Any comedy album that has Justin Timberlake, Paul McCartney, Eddie Vedder, Dave Matthews, Bruce Springsteen \u2013 that's pretty crazy. If I was 15-year-old me, I would be like, 'Oh my God, this is awesome!' Though I'd probably be like, 'Who's Dave Matthews?' because he doesn't exist yet.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/06/cover-story-jimmy-fallon-and-the-rise-of-tebowie|title=Cover Story: Jimmy Fallon And The Rise Of Tebowie|work=American Songwriter}}</ref>
